# Book Recommendation System
### Abstract
With traditional methods of reading being replaced by the world on the web, recommendation systems
have become a necessity more than just a luxury. More and more companies are investing in building
recommendation systems to engage users by providing them with personalized recommendations which
depend on the usersâ€™ own behaviors. These systems have proved to be a significant part in boosting sales
of various companies. Our aim was to build a recommendation system using various techniques such as
content based filtering and collaborative filtering.
### Introduction
The aim of this project was to recommend books to users based on different techniques, depending on the
user preference. The book crossing dataset was downloaded from Kaggle. The dataset underwent
pre-processing, and a few insights were made from the dataset by performing exploratory data analysis on
the dataset. Using these insights and various techniques, recommendation systems were designed.
Every technique does not necessarily recommend the same set of books to the users for the same input
book. Every technique takes a book as an input and yields recommendations based on a different
similarity metric. These metrics include cosine similarity, correlation, or k-nearest neighbors.
